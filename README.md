A powerful and modern C++ based game engine, currently in early development.

**Note: ** Development for C++ has paused, as we're trying to port the engine to Rust.

## Index
This README file is split into multiple sections:

## Why another game engine?
Well, this project is mainly for learning purposes. The aim is to make a powerful, flexible and lightweight game engine, since I haven't really found any exisitng Engines that I like.
