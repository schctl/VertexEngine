## Why another game engine?
Well, this project is mainly for learning purposes. Additionally, I wish to build a flexible, powerful and lightweight game engine because I haven't found any game engines that I particularly like.

## Supported platforms and rendering APIs
| Platform | Rendering API |
|----------|---------------|
| Windows  | OpenGL        |
| Linux    | OpenGL        |
