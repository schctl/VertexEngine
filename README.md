# Vertex Engine

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/VertexEngine/VertexEngine?color=blue)](https://github.com/VertexEngine/VertexEngine/blob/master/LICENSE)

A powerful C++ based game engine, currently in early development. I'm developing this engine following along [TheCherno](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT)'s tutorial, so there are probably many implementation similarities.

## Index
This README file is split into multiple sections:
* [Support](https://github.com/VertexEngine/VertexEngine#support)

* [Authors and Acknowledgements](https://github.com/VertexEngine/VertexEngine#authors)

## Why another game engine?
Well, this project is mainly for learning purposes. Additionally, I wish to build a flexible, powerful and lightweight game engine because I haven't found any game engines that I particularly like.

## Support
You can join the official Vertex Engine [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hA5kHnK), to ask for help or make a feature request. You can also contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/42_mix).

## Build
Pre-made build scripts are provided for Windows and Linux in the `scripts` directory. The build scripts **must be run from within that directory.**

## Roadmap
Vertex aims to be a lightweight and powerful game engine. We plan on supporting multiple rendering APIs including DirectX12 and Vulkan. We also plan on adding Mac support sometime in the future.
