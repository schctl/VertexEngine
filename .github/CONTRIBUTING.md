## Code style

It is important for a healthy code base to have a consistent style through all internal code. This extends to design patterns as well as just the formatting of the code itself.

### Code formatting
* Indents are 4 spaces, and not tabs.
* All variables, and arguments are in the `snake_case`.
* Static and private member variables must be prefixed with `s_` and `m_` respectively, and be followed by its name in `PascalCase`.
* All classes, structs, and enum classes are in the `PascalCase`.
* All macros are in the `UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE`.

### Patterns
* All C++ files have the `.cpp` extension.
* Attempt to maximize performace.
* Prefer documented code.
* Minimize external dependencies, so that the code can almost work out of the box.
