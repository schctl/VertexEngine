## Code style

It is important for a healthy code base to have a consistent style through all internal code. This extends to design patterns as well as just the formatting of the code itself.

### Code formatting
Vertex formatting is based on the [WebKit coding style](https://webkit.org/code-style-guidelines/) with a few exceptions (see `.clang-format`).

### Patterns
* Header files must have the `.h` extension.

* Use `#pragma once` instead of include guards.

* File names must be in `PascalCase`.

* Include only necessary headers.

* Include common header files in `Vertex/src/Core/vx_pch.h`.
